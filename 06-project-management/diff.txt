Notes on differences between self solution and instructor solution:

- <aside> element for Project sidebar parent: helps with semantic markup, making the structure of the page clearer to not just developers, but also search engines and assistive technologies like screen readers.

- <menu> element for Cancel/Save buttons in Create new project component - limited support in browsers. Therefore <ul> or <div> elems with appropriate ARIA (??) roles and properties are often preferred to create menus and buttons. 
    - ARIA - Accessible rich internet applications
            - landmark roles for navigation - nav, main, aside     
            - widget roles for types of interaction available - button, link, menu, menuitem
            - document structure roles to help understand the structure of the document- article, heading, list, listitem 
            - application roles to distinguish from standard web content - application element indicates that the web app inside has its own keyboard navigation etc.
